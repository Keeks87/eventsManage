# Events Application

## System Architecture

   To develop the events application, I've opted for the **MERN** stack, comprising **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**. This stack is widely recognized for constructing full-stack web applications and delivers a robust and scalable architectural foundation.

### Front-End Design

   For the front-end, I'll utilize **React.js** along with **Create React App** (CRA).

   React.js, a popular JavaScript library for crafting user interfaces, coupled with CRA, a tool that streamlines React project setup and configuration, simplifies development and codebase maintenance.

### Back-End Setup

   The back-end will leverage **Node.js** in tandem with **Express.js**.

   Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime, teams up with Express.js, a web application framework, to facilitate API development and server-side logic handling. MongoDB will serve as the database for event-related data storage.

### Deployment Strategy

   The application will be hosted on the cloud platform **Render**, which offers scalable infrastructure and user-friendly deployment options, ensuring easy access for users from anywhere.

### Styling Approach

   For styling, I'll employ a combination of **CSS** and a CSS framework like **Bootstrap**.

   CSS enables custom styling and layout, while CSS frameworks supply pre-designed components and responsive layouts, reducing development time and maintaining consistency throughout the application.

## System Requirements Specification

### Application Overview

   The events application aims to provide a platform for advertising and managing upcoming events. It caters to two distinct user types:

1. **Regular end-users:**

   These users can access a list of upcoming events and access event details.

2. **Administrators:**

   Administrators possess additional privileges, allowing them to add new events, modify event information, and manage event-related tasks.

### User Stories

1. As a regular end-user, I want to view a list of upcoming events to plan my attendance.

2. As a regular end-user, I want to access detailed event information, including date, time, location, and description.

3. As an admin, I want to add new events, specifying event title, date, time, location, and description.

4. As an admin, I want to edit event details, such as updating date, time, or location.

5. As an admin, I want to cancel events and inform registered users.

6. As an admin, I want to see a list of registered users for each event.

7. As an admin, I want to generate reports on event attendance and statistics.

### Comparison with Existing Software

   While similar event management applications like **Meetup** exist, the events application seeks to distinguish itself through the following attributes:

1. **Simplicity:**

   The application will prioritize the unique needs of events, offering an intuitive and streamlined interface for event management, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

2. **Cost-effectiveness:**

   The application will be budget-friendly, allowing events to promote their events without significant expenses.

3. **Customizable:**

   The application will offer flexibility for events to tailor event listings to their branding.

4. **Integration:**

   The application can seamlessly integrate with existing systems, enhancing event management workflows.

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Registration and Authentication**

   - Users can create accounts and log in to access additional features.

   - Administrators can perform privileged actions after authentication.

2. **Event Listing and Details**

   - Users can view a list of upcoming events.

   - Users can click on an event to view detailed information.

   - Users can register for events they wish to attend.

3. **Event Management**

   - Administrators can add new events to the system.

   - Administrators can edit event information.

   - Administrators can cancel events and notify registered users.

   - Administrators can access a list of registered users for each event.

### Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance:**

   The application must exhibit responsiveness and high performance, ensuring a smooth user experience even with a substantial number of events and users.

2. **Security:**

   User authentication and data storage must be robustly secure, protecting user data and averting unauthorized access.

3. **Usability:**

   The application must provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making navigation and actions straightforward for both end-users and administrators.

4. **Accessibility:**

   The application must adhere to accessibility standards to guarantee effective access and use for users with disabilities.
